# Edge AI Model Quantization & Android Deployment Project

## Overview
Demonstrating Post-Training INT8 Quantization on MobileNetV2, simulating MediaTek NeuroPilot Quantization Tool workflow.

## Key Results
- Model size reduced 70-75% (~14MB → 4MB)
- Faster inference and lower power consumption
- Successfully deployed to Android App using TensorFlow Lite
